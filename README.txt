== How to compile and run the demo on a Unix system ==

Prequisite
First, you need to have Qt4 or Qt5 development environment installed.
See: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/gettingstarted.html

Run from a console:
> cd src
> qmake
> make
> cd ..
> ./demo1.sh

This will download some test data (if needed) and show it.

You can also run "./demo1.sh B" which will run the second demo.
